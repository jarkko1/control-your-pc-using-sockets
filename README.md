# Control your PC with commands

## Requirements



This has been tested only on ```Windows 10```, so i don't know if it will work on older versions

## Usage

1. Download the files in this repository

2. Run the ``` server.py ```

3. Then run the ```client.py```

4. Now the client will connect to the server.

## Info

The client will only connect to the server if the server is running on the same computer, BUT there is a way how you can control your computer from almost any device.

## Control your computer/laptop from another computer/laptop.
